# Pyber Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help V. Isualize to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. With the help of Pandas and Matplotlib, we are asked to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, a summary of how data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by decision makers at Pyber is submitted to V.Isualize and Omar.
In this project, we'll use Python3.7.6, Conda and Jupyter Notebook to visualize and analyze the ride share data.
Data Source:city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Results
Results of the analysis are as follows;
Urban cities lead in all categories of ride counts, driver counts, and total percentage fare amount, followed by suburban cities and rural cities.
The Chart below from January to April (2019) timeframe shows the visual analysis;

Further, average fare per ride and average fare per driver is high in urban cities followed by suburban and rural areas.

## Summary
With this analysis the three recommendations that I would suggest are;
1. Urban cities has more population, so addition of electric scooters or bikes that people can use for short commute can widen the market. 
2. Addition of Promotion campaigns such as customer loyalty program. 
3. Provide incentice to drivers to drive in rural or sub-urban areas.
